# Regulatory-Project-Management-Plan-for-Kal-PDx

IMHD has developed this plan for Kalia Health’s preeclampsia diagnostic, Kal-PDx. Kalia Health is a health justice company dedicated to improving access to maternal health care through early detection of preeclampsia, a pregnancy complication. They are in the early stages of developing their product, Kal-PDx, and will use this plan to guide their regulatory submissions. IMHD researched the FDA requirements for submitting requests to register a new medical device and determined the relevant requirements needed for each stage of the regulatory process.

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Our Objective:
The main objective of this project is centered around providing Kalia Health with a detailed regulatory plan which will drive their meetings, submissions and overall effort for seeking FDA approval for their new diagnostic tool, Kal-PDx. 

PROJECT SCOPE:
This project will result in an exhaustive list of required documents and a detailed regulatory plan needed to better prepare Kalia Health for the FDA regulatory process. Preparations for pre-market regulatory submissions and interactions with regulatory authorities will help achieve commercialization milestones and are included in the scope of this project. 
As part of our project, the plan will help in doing the following: (1) identifying key documents needed, (2) developing a flowchart outlining requests and applications applicable to Kalia Health’s medical device, and (3) prioritizing deadlines and anticipated application fees.

PROJECT CLOSING:
Closing of the project began at the start of the project, specifically when our project sponsor clearly defined different project criteria and her overall expectations. 
At the end of the project, a final project report was shared with our project sponsor. This report included an exhaustive list of regulatory documents that will be required to register Kal-Pdx and a flowchart summarizing the FDA regulatory process. The project report can also include more information stating completed tasks and issues dealt with while also including notes explaining why certain issues were faced. We sent the documents to our project sponsor prior to our last meeting with her. In our last meeting, we made sure that we met her expectations, and she was satisfied with what we delivered.
